# Pokémon Sprites

This project was built using a Pokemon API to load up the generation's sprites from the Pokémon games. This project was inspired by Colt Steele's Web Dev course and I decided to follow along because 1) I wanted more API practice and 2) the new pokémon games are coming out tomorrow.

I could see myself coming back and styling this, creating an actual functioning Pokedex when time allots. I saw a few on Github that were particularly creative.
